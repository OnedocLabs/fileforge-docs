title: Working with Files
---

Working with files can be tricky in Node.js and the browser. Here are the general do's and don'ts, as well as examples on how to handle files.

<Callout intent="warning" title="Memory Usage">
  When working with files, always be mindful of memory usage. Reading a large
  file into memory can cause your application to crash. If you need to read a
  large file, consider using streams.
</Callout>

## In the browser

All modern browsers and Deno implement the [File API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File). It is the recommended way to interact with the Fileforge API and SDKs in the browser.

The `File` object associates a content stream with important metadata like the file's name, size, and MIME type.

### Creating a File instance

#### Creating a File object from a Blob, Buffer or String

```ts
const pdfFile = new File([pdfData], "example.pdf", { type: "application/pdf" });
const htmlFile = new File([`<p>Hello World!</p>`], "example.html", {
  type: "text/html",
});
```

#### Creating a File object from a File input

```ts
const fileInput = document.getElementById("fileInput") as HTMLInputElement;
const file = fileInput.files[0];
```

### Consuming a File

#### Creating a URL for a File

Creating an object URL for a file is useful when you need to display the file in a specific context like an `<iframe>`, or if you want to trigger a download.

```ts
const url = URL.createObjectURL(pdfFile);

// Use the URL in an iframe
const iframe = document.createElement("iframe");
iframe.src = url;

// Open the file in a new tab
window.open(url);
```

### Converting a ReadableStream to a File

<Callout intent="note">
  This example is only applicable in browser-like environments. In Node.js
  environments, the SDK response is a `Readable` rather than a `ReadableStream`.
</Callout>

When interacting with API methods that return a file, the SDK will return a `ReadableStream`. Here is how to convert it back to a `File` object.

```ts
// Note: this API call returns a ReadableStream only in browser-like environments
const file = (await ff.pdf.generate(html, {
  options: {
    host: false,
  },
})) as ReadableStream;

// Note: this accumulates the entire file in memory
const blob = await new Response(file).blob();
const fileObject = new File([blob], "file.pdf", {
  type: "application/pdf",
});

const url = URL.createObjectURL(fileObject);

window.open(url);
```

## In Node.js

Node.js does not have a built-in `File` object like the browser. We recommend working with the polyfill from [`formdata-node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/formdata-node) that provides a similar API to the browser. `formdata-node` is shipped with the Fileforge SDK.

### Reading a File

#### From an existing file

```ts
import { File } from "formdata-node";
import { readFile } from "fs/promises";

const pdfFile = new File([await readFile("example.pdf")], "example.pdf", {
  type: "application/pdf",
});
```

#### From an existing file, streamed

```ts
import { File } from "formdata-node";
import { createReadStream } from "fs";

// Create a File object from a stream
class BlobFromStream {
  #stream;

  constructor(stream, size) {
    this.#stream = stream;
    this.size = size;
  }

  stream() {
    return this.#stream;
  }

  get [Symbol.toStringTag]() {
    return "Blob";
  }
}

const pdfFile = new File(
  [new BlobFromStream(createReadStream("example.pdf"))],
  "example.pdf",
  {
    type: "application/pdf",
  }
);
```

#### Without using File

In some cases, you may not want or need to use the `File` object. You can work with the file directly using streams. Note that some endpoints, such as `generate` and `merge` rely on file names to determine root files and links. Not passing Files may cause issues with these endpoints.

```ts
const file = (await ff.pdf.generate(createReadStream("./index.html"), {
  options: {
    host: false,
  },
})) as Readable;
```

### Consuming a SDK response

When interacting with API methods that return a file, the SDK will return a `Readable`. Here is how to consume it.

```ts
import { createWriteStream } from "fs";

const file = (await ff.pdf.generate(createReadStream("./index.html"), {
  options: {
    host: false,
  },
})) as Readable;

file.pipe(createWriteStream("file.pdf"));
```
