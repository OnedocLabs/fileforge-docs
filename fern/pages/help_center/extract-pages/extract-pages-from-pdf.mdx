This documentation provides an example of how to use the FileforgeClient to extract pages from a PDF.

#### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following:

- An API key for Fileforge as an environment variable: **process.env.FILEFORGE_API_KEY**
- Node.js and npm installed.
- The Fileforge Client [installed](/getting-started/general/authentication).

#### Guide

<Steps>

### Make sure to set a timeout for the request

If you are extracting pages from a very large file, you may need to increase the timeout as shown below with the `timeoutInSeconds` parameter.

### Extract the pages

```typescript
import { FileforgeClient } from "@fileforge/client";
import * as fs from "fs";

BETA TESTING - NOT YET AVAILABLE
contact@fileforge.com for more information
```

### About the options and output

You can pass the following parameters to the `extract` method:

- `startPage`: The index of the first page to extract. The index is one-based, so the first page is 1.
- `endPage`: The index of the last page to extract (included). The index is one-based.

The extract method returns a `.pdf` file containing the extracted pages. The name of the output file is original file name suffixed with `_extracted_startPage_endPage`.
