This documentation provides an example of how to use the FileforgeClient to split a PDF into 2 PDFs.

#### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following:

- An API key for Fileforge as an environment variable: **process.env.FILEFORGE_API_KEY**
- Node.js and npm installed.
- The Fileforge Client [installed](/getting-started/general/authentication).

#### Guide

<Steps>

### Make sure to set a timeout for the request

If you are splitting a very large file, you may need to increase the timeout as shown below with the `timeoutInSeconds` parameter.

### Split the PDF

```typescript
import { FileforgeClient } from "@fileforge/client";
import * as fs from "fs";

BETA TESTING - NOT YET AVAILABLE
contact@fileforge.com for more information
```

### About the options and output

You can pass the following parameters to the `split` method:

- `splitIndex`: The index at which to split the PDF. The index is one-based, so the first page is 1.

The `split` method returns a `.zip` file containing the split PDFs. The `.zip` file contains the split PDFs as individual PDF files. It limits the size of the response.
